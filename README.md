# @LightningTipBot üèÖ

A Telegram Lightning ‚ö°Ô∏è Bitcoin wallet and tip bot for group chats.

This repository contains everything you need to set up and run your own tip bot. If you simply want to use this bot in your group chat without having to install anything just start a conversation with [@LightningTipBot](https://t.me/LightningTipBot) and invite it into your group chat.

## Setting up the bot

### Installation

To build the bot from source, clone the repository and compile the source code.

```
git clone https://github.com/LightningTipBot/LightningTipBot.git
cd LightningTipBot
go build .
cp config.yaml-example config.yaml
```

After the configuration (see below), start it using the command

```
./LightningTipBot
```

### Configuration

You need to edit `config.yaml` before starting the bot.

#### Create a Telegram bot

First, create a new Telegram bot by starting a conversation with the [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather). After you have created your bot, you will get an **Api Token** which you need to add to `telegram_api_key` in config.yaml accordingly.

#### Set up LNbits

You can either use your own LNbits instance (recommended) or create an account at [lnbits.com](https://lnbits.com/) to use their custodial service (easy).

1. Create a wallet in LNbits (`lnbits_url`).
2. Get the **Admin key** in the API Info tab of your user (`lnbits_admin_key`).
3. Enable the User Manager extension.
4. Get the **Admin ID** of the User Manager (`lnbits_admin_id`).

#### Getting LNbits keys

#### More configuration

- `webhook_server`: URL that can reach the bot. This is used for creating webhooks with LNbits to receive notifications about payments (optional).
- `db_path`: User database file path.
- `transactions_path`: Transaction log file path.
- `message_dispose_duration`: Duration in seconds after which commands will be deleted from channel (only if the bot is channel admin).

</p>

### Link to BlueWallet or Zap

Every user can link their wallet to an external app like [Bluewallet](https://bluewallet.io/) or [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/) by using the command `/link`. If you host the bot, you will have to enable the LndHub extension in LNbits. You also need to edit the `lnbits_public_url` entry in `config.yaml` accordingly to an address that can be reached by the user's wallet (Tor should be fine as well).

### Pay invoices by sending QR codes

To pay a Lightning invoice, you can snap a photo of a QR code and send it directly to the bot. Note that you might need to zoom in, center the QR code, or crop the image if the bot fails to decode the QR code from the photo. By the way, you can also just send an the invoice as a string, the bot will automatically detect it and initiate a payment.

### Auto-delete commands

To minimize the clutter all the heavy tipping can cause in a group chat, the bot will remove all failed commands (for example due to a syntax error) from the chat immediately. All successful commands will stay visible for `message_dispose_duration` seconds (default 10s) and then be removed. The tips will sill be visible for everyone in the Live tooltip. This feature only works, if the bot is made admin of the group.
